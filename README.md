# Perspective change pipeline

This pipeline was developed as part of my Multimodal Machine Learning Project in 11-777 where we explored text based image editing. 

We split image editing into 12 different types of tasks which included perspective changes, instance specific color changes, overall image color changes, texture changes, background changes, size changes, movement changes, etc.

One of the limitations we noticed in existing image editing models is that they were incapable of performing perspective changes well as shown in the figure below.

Thus we developed a pipeline to performing perspective changes by lifting the image from 2D to 3D using MoGe, a monocular depth estimator, creating a mesh and re-rendering the scene. Inpainting is then done to fill in the unknown areas.

In this repo we include the Gradio App for testing, We use a RTX 3090 with 24GB VRAM to run the demo.
